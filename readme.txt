PLEASE NOTE-> 
‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Warning Notice
You may receive a warning from Windows (SmartScreen) when running the .exe.
This is expected, because:

The program uses keyboard and pynput to simulate key presses.

These libraries can also listen to keyboard input, which antivirus and security systems sometimes flag.

This behavior is common in automation tools and does not indicate a virus ‚Äî especially if you built it yourself or downloaded it from my trusted GitHub.
